This is an experimental FPS aim assist I created in 2020 to see how hard it was to make one from scratch. I have decided to make it public since the memory offsets are likely outdated and therefore this cannot be compiled and used online.
It features the following:

* Automatically locks onto the target closest to the user's crosshair.
* Improved field of view and zoom
* Enables faster movement by allowing frame perfect jumps.
* Removal of client side recoil, flinch and screenshake effects.
