This is an experimental FPS cheat I created in 2020 to see how hard it was to make one from scratch. I have decided to make it public since the memory offsets are likely outdated and therefore this cannot be compiled and used online.
It features the following:

* Lock on aimbot to the target closest to the user's crosshair.
* Unlocked FOV, allowing for zooming in and out beyond normal capability.
* Bunny hop, allowing for faster movement.
* Removal of client side recoil, flinch and drunkness effects.
